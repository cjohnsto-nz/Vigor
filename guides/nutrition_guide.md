# Vigor Nutrition System Guide

This guide explains how the nutrition system in the Vigor mod affects your character's stamina and performance. By maintaining a balanced diet, you can gain significant advantages.

## Nutrition Categories and Bonuses

The Vigor mod enhances the vanilla nutrition system by providing stamina-related bonuses based on five core nutrition categories. Each category provides a primary and a secondary bonus that scales linearly as your nutrition level for that category increases from 0 to 100%.

Here are the bonuses for each category:

### ü•© Protein
- **Primary Bonus**: Increases your stamina recovery rate up to **+50%**.
- **Secondary Bonus**: Increases your maximum stamina up to **+20%**.

### üåæ Grain
- **Primary Bonus**: Increases your maximum stamina up to **+50%**.
- **Secondary Bonus**: Reduces the stamina cost of jumping up to **-20%**.

### ü•ï Vegetable
- **Primary Bonus**: Reduces the rate at which your stamina drains from actions up to **-50%**.
- **Secondary Bonus**: Lowers the stamina threshold required to recover from exhaustion up to **-20%**.

### üçé Fruit
- **Primary Bonus**: Reduces the stamina cost of jumping up to **-50%**.
- **Secondary Bonus**: Reduces the rate at which your stamina drains from actions up to **-20%**.

### ü•õ Dairy
- **Primary Bonus**: Lowers the stamina threshold required to recover from exhaustion up to **-50%**.
- **Secondary Bonus**: Increases your stamina recovery rate up to **+20%**.

## How it Works

- The bonuses are applied directly based on your character's vanilla nutrition levels, which you can see on your character screen (default key 'C').
- The effects stack, so a balanced diet across all categories will provide the best overall performance.
- All modifier values can be configured by the server administrator in the `vigor.json` config file.

Stay energized and keep your Vigor up by eating a variety of foods!
